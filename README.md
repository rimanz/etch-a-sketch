# etch-a-sketch
This is another project from "The Odin Project" curriculum. This project is replicates a simple sketch pad, where one can draw something in different colors, clear-out the drawings, and resize the pad itself(according to the number of pixels it might have).
By default a 16x16 sized pad is created. It can be resized down to 10x10 and resized up to 100x100 by clicking the "New" button. Drawing can be cleared by clicking "Clear".
